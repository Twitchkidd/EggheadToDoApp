# EggheadToDoApp

Totally didn't realize I hadn't pushed Lesson 4. It worked, though, I promise.

Hooohkeyday, so, this worked really quite well with an iPhone 6 simulator, and worked with an Android emulator, though the styles didn't look great, and it technically worked on an iPhone 5 device, but the text on the bottom row ran off the screen. I got a good amount of grind in on passing functions as props, and saw some of the things that I hadn't used before, like AsyncStorage, and learned about some array methods, which was great. 10/10, would recommend as long as you aren't expecting to know absolutely everything there is to know about React Native or to have a 100% polished app at the end. Still dope. ~g
